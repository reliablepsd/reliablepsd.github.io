				<h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
				<p><strong>THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.</strong></p>
				<p>These Terms of Use (“<u>Terms</u>”) govern your use of the Makeena, Inc., and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “<u>Makeena</u>”) service available through our websites located at https://makeena.com and https://commonkindness.com (the
					“<u>Website</u>”), and software applications, including the application entitled “<em>Makeena</em>” and “<em>CommonKindness</em>” (each, an “<u>App</u>” and collectively, “<u>Apps</u>”) that, in part, enables users to search for, locate, and compare healthy and sustainable products and
					brands, as well as create shopping lists, compare nutritional information, earn loyalty rewards, and receive special cash back incentives, rebates, and coupons from brands (collectively, the functionality provided by the Website and App referred to as the “<u>Service</u>”). By browsing
					our Website, downloading and installing the App, or registering for or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understand these Terms and agree to be bound by them. If not, do not download the Apps or use the Website or Service.</p>
				<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING, BROWSING, OR USING THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE, CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, AND/OR DOWNLOADING THE APP, YOU REPRESENT (1) THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A
						BINDING CONTRACT WITH MAKEENA, AND (2) YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS OF USE PERSONALLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE, APP, OR SERVICES.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>1.REGISTRATION</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li><u>Member Accounts</u>. To use certain features of the Service, you must register and create an account (“<u>Account</u>”). To be eligibleto create an Account, you must be at least 16 years old. When you set up your account, you will be required to create log-in
						credentials by providing certain types of personal information (“<u>Login Credentials</u>”). For more information on the types of personal information we will collect in order to create your Login Credentials, please review our <u>Privacy Policy</u>. You are responsible for
						maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Credentials, and are solely responsible for all activities that occur using your Login Credentials. You are allowed to create only one Account per mobile device and only one Account per individual. You agree not to allow a third party
						to use your Login Credentials at any time. We reserve the right to terminate any username and password, or not pay out any loyalty rewards, special cash back incentives, rebates, or coupons, which we reasonably determine may have been used by an unauthorized third party or
						accumulated in violation of these Terms.</li>
					<li><u>Social Networking Accounts</u>. You may also link your Account with certain third party social networking services, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and/or Google+ (a “<u>SNS Account</u>”) by either (i) providing your SNS Account login information to us;
						or (ii) allowing us to access your SNS Account, if permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each SNS Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your SNS Account login information to us and/or grant us access to your SNS Account
						without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable SNS Account and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
						THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR SNS ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE PROVIDERS.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><strong>2.HOW COUPONS, CASH BACK INCENTIVES, LOYALTY REWARDS, AND/OR REBATES ON THE SERVICES WORK</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li><u>Generally</u>. Certain brands, merchants, and retailers (collectively, “<u>Brands</u>”) may offer users, via the Services, certain discounts, coupons, cash back incentives, loyalty rewards, and/or rebates (“<u>Rebates</u>”) related to their products (those products
						subject to a Rebate, “<u>Qualifying Products</u>”). After purchasing Qualifying Products from the supermarket, retailer (including online retailers), or natural foods store, users may redeem their Rebates by scanning the product’s Universal Product Code (“<u>UPC</u>”) and then
						taking and uploading a photo of their receipt to the Service. After confirmation by the Service of the purchase of Qualifying Products, the Service will remit the applicable Rebate to the user’s Payment Account (as defined in Section 2(b) below) within a reasonable amount of time.
					</li>
					<li><u>Payment Accounts</u>. In order to receive a Rebate using the Service, you will need to create an account (“<u>Payment Account</u>”) with third party payment providers identified on the Service (“<u>Payment Provider</u>”). Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use
						of your Payment Account and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. All Rebates for the purchase of Qualifying Products will be deposited in your Payment Account by your Payment Provider. If your Payment Account does not match
						your Account, Makeena has the right to not pay out Rebates.</li>
					<li><u>Rebate Terms</u>. In addition to the terms and conditions of these Terms, any Rebates offered through the App, Website, Brand, or Payment Provider may be governed by specific terms and conditions that are separate from this Agreement. Rebates may be subject to
						limitations, including, without limitation, geographic limitations, or number of Rebates offered by Brands. We urge you to review any specific terms and conditions applicable to a particular Rebate. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such Rebates conflict with these
						Terms, the terms and conditions of the applicable Rebate will control.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>In order to receive a Rebate, users must scan the UPC and upload a photo of their receipt for the purchase of Qualifying Products to the Service no later than the claim by date, or as set forth in the applicable Rebate or on the App. All Rebates are also
					subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Rebate offer or promotion. All Rebate claims are subject to Makeena’s final, sole, and absolute review and approval. If a Rebate submission is incomplete or fails to meet any of the terms and conditions applicable to such Rebate, no
					Rebate will be issued. Applicable tax, if any, is the sole responsibility of the user.</p>
				<p>You understand and agree that the Service uses a series of algorithms and optical recognition technologies to convert the photographed images of your receipts into digital text. This automated process is often prone to errors, and as such, you understand that
					you are solely responsible for confirming that your purchase of all Qualifying Products is accurately reflected on the Services. You further understand and agree, any alteration, blurring, burning, charring, darkening, destruction, obscuring, obfuscation, ripping, smearing, tearing, or
					other damage to your receipts may impact your ability to upload evidence of your purchase of Qualifying Products to the Service. Makeena assumes no liability for the accuracy or completeness of any receipt or other information you upload to the Services, or any inaccuracies or failures
					of the Services to translate photographs of your receipts into digital text.</p>

						Makeena Properties. Otherwise, your continued use of the Makeena Properties constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE AND APP TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.</span></p>
				<p><strong>18.TERMINATION.</strong> Makeena may cancel, suspend, or block your use of the Service without notice if there has been a violation of these Terms. Your right to use the Service will end once your registration is terminated,
					and any data, including Rebates, you have stored on the Service, including any User Content may be unavailable later, unless Makeena is required to retain it by law. You may terminate your registration at any time. Makeena is not responsible or liable for any records, Rebates, or
					information that is made unavailable to you as a result of your termination of registration. <strong>YOU AGREE THAT MAKEENA WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE.</strong> Any limitations on liability that favor Makeena will
					survive the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason.</p>
				<p><strong>19.CONSUMER COMPLAINTS.</strong> In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs
					by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
				<p><strong>20.MISCELLANEOUS.</strong> Makeena’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. If any part of these Terms is determined to be
					invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the
					intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent
					and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. All contracts completed electronically will be deemed for all legal purposes to be in writing and legally enforceable as a signed writing.</p>
